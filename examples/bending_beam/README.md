# Introduction

This is a demo project for using Quanscient Allsolve SDK to do a simple
bending beam simulation with a sweep over some project parameters.

# Prerequisites

Follow [Installation](../README.md#installation) and [Running](../README.md#running)
in the parent example README to set up Python, install the Allsolve SDK,
and configure credentials.

# Running

From the `examples/` directory:

```
(venv) $ python bending_beam/bending_beam_sweep.py
```

When prompted `Delete project? [Y/n]`, answer **`n`** if you plan to run the visualize
script below.

# Visualization

After the simulation has finished, install this example's dependencies and visualize the results:

```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(venv) $ python visualize_bending_beam_sweep_results.py
```
